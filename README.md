I started out Test Driving the code but decided to stop doing that and focus on the functionality in the spirit of time. All exising tests are green.

I did get held up by a bug in my DB Connection string (D'oh!).

Some things I would have liked to do if I had more time:

- Add more tests
- Add error handling
- Add logging
- Add more\better validation
- Done something more secure with the DB Connection string.
